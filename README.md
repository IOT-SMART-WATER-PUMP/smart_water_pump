# IoT Smart Water Pump

[![License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)](LICENSE)

This project showcases a smart water pump system designed with IoT capabilities to monitor and manage water usage efficiently. The IoT Smart Water Pump uses sensors and a microcontroller to automatically control water flow, detect water levels, and send real-time data to a cloud platform for monitoring and remote access. The system can help optimize water usage, prevent overflow, and reduce water wastage, making it ideal for use in households, agriculture, and industrial settings.

## Features
- **Automatic Water Level Monitoring**: Continuously monitors water tank levels to ensure optimal water usage and avoid overflow.
- **Remote Control & Monitoring**: Allows remote activation/deactivation of the pump.
- **Water Usage Data Collection**: Logs water usage data in the cloud for insights and analysis.
- **Energy Efficient**: Turns off automatically when water reaches desired levels to save energy.
- **Alerts and Notifications**: Sends alerts for low/high water levels, potential leaks, and usage statistics.
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable thresholds for water levels to match different applications.

## Components
- **Microcontroller**: ESP8266/ESP32 (or similar) to connect the system to Wi-Fi and process data.
- **Ultrasonic Sensor**: Measures water level in the tank.
- **Water Flow Sensor**: Tracks water flow rate and usage.
- **Relay Module**: Controls the pump motor based on signals from the microcontroller.
- **Power Supply**: Provides power to the microcontroller and sensors.
- **Cloud Platform (e.g., Firebase or AWS IoT)**: Stores data and enables remote monitoring and control.

## Installation
1. **Set Up Hardware**:
   - Connect the ultrasonic sensor to the microcontroller to measure water levels.
   - Attach the water flow sensor in line with the pump to monitor flow rate.
   - Connect the relay module to control the pump motor based on water levels.

2. **Cloud Integration**:
   - Set up a database in Firebase (or your preferred cloud service) to log and retrieve data.
   - Update the code with your API keys and database URLs for cloud connection.

3. **Testing**:
   - Test the setup to ensure the sensors read accurately and the pump responds based on the water level.

## Usage
1. **Remote Monitoring**:
   - Access the web/mobile app to view water level and usage data.
   
2. **Control the Pump**:
   - Turn the pump on or off remotely as required.
   

## Future Improvements
- **Machine Learning**: Predict water usage patterns for better water management.
- **Solar Power Integration**: Make the system more sustainable by adding a solar power source.
- **Multi-Tank Compatibility**: Expand compatibility to monitor and control multiple tanks.

## Troubleshooting
- **No Data in Cloud**: Check Wi-Fi connection and cloud API credentials.
- **Pump Doesnâ€™t Respond**: Verify relay connections and ensure the pump motor is functional.
- **Incorrect Water Levels**: Recalibrate the ultrasonic sensor and check sensor positioning.
